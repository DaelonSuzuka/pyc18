For\nexample, if the data latch is \u20181\u2019 for a pin configured as input and is driven low by an external device, the data will be written back with a \u20180\u2019.\n2.\nIf Program Counter (PC) is modified or a conditional test is true, the instruction requires two cycles. The second cycle is executed as a NOP.\n3.\nSome instructions are multi-word instructions. The extra words of these instructions will be executed as a NOP unless the first word of the instruction\nretrieves the information embedded in these 16 bits. This ensures that all program memory locations have a valid instruction.\n4.\nfs and fd do not cover the full memory range. 2 MSbs of bank selection are forced to 0b00 to limit the range of these instructions to the lower 4k\naddressing space.","1":"","2":"","3":"","4":"","5":"","6":"","7":"","8":"","9":""}]
